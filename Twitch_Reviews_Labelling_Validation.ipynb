    "## 🏁 6. Final Conclusions & Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Key Performance Insights\n",
    "Based on the quality audit of **55,989 samples**, the following conclusions were drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Strong Heuristic Consistency:** A **Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.8211** indicates **substantial to near-perfect agreement** between the rule-based lexical heuristic and user-provided ratings. This suggests strong alignment under clearly polarized sentiment conditions and indicates that the selected domain-specific keywords (e.g., *“pog”*, *“revert”*, *“tiktok”*) capture dominant sentiment signals commonly expressed in Twitch reviews.\n",
    "* **High Label Consistency:** The observed **Agreement Rate of 94.90%** reflects a high level of consistency between numerical ratings and textual feedback, which is notable for large-scale social media review datasets.\n",
    "* **Effective Inconsistency Identification:** The pipeline identified **4,909 samples (8.7%)** exhibiting **potential label inconsistency**, where the sentiment expressed in text diverges from the assigned star rating. These cases often correspond to sarcasm, mixed sentiment, or rating bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Impact on AI Training\n",
    "Identifying potentially inconsistent samples is critical for improving downstream machine learning workflows:\n",
    "1. **Reduced Noisy Supervision:** Excluding or correcting highly inconsistent samples may prevent models from learning misleading or spurious correlations.\n",
    "2. **Improved Model Robustness:** Training on higher-consistency data can help models better distinguish dominant patterns in complaints versus praise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Future Recommendations\n",
    "To further enhance this NLP pipeline, the following steps are recommended:\n",
    "* **N-gram Analysis:** Incorporate **bigrams** to better capture negation and contextual polarity (e.g., distinguishing *“not good”* from *“good”*).\n",
    "* **Human-in-the-Loop Validation:** Implement a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** process where samples flagged as potentially inconsistent are manually reviewed or re-annotated.\n",
    "* **Model Benchmarking:** Following dataset auditing, future work may involve training and benchmarking **transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)** on the high-consistency subset to evaluate potential performance improvements over traditional approaches.\n"
